This page details the design, materials, and construction of an extubation enclosure for hospital settings. It has been developed in a partnership between physicians at University Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) and engineers at Robarts Research Institute (RRI), Western University.

## Design History
A number of iterations have been produced with the following features:
1. Initial 3D printed design: rib-cage style assembly from 3D printed pieces
1. Initial OR cage design: use of surgical arms to act as a frame, plastic bag draped over the top
1. Second cage design: cage style assembly from 3D printed pieces and 3/4" PVC plumbing pipe + fittings
1. Third cage design: cage style assembly made from 3/4" PVC plumbing pipe + fittings

## References
- A 3 sided + top design with rigid plastic walls. Excellent spatter containment but no management of dispersal into the surrounding airspace; limited range of motion for physicians; excellent access for tubing/tools/hands:
